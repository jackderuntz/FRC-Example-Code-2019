# FRC-Example-Code-2019
This is code for the DemoBOT which was retrofitted to be able to be useful for the 2019 season. I went back and commented it a lot so that it should be easy to interpret for anyone. If you have any questions you can message me on Slack.

# How to open and use the program

## 1. Install FRC Visual Studio Code
In order to get this working seamlessly, uninstall any versions of VS Code you may already have.
[Link for Installer](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc)
Make Sure you follow every step carefully, or else you may get confused in between and it will not work.
     
## 2. Install the Update Suite

It will ask you for a serial number, contact Jack DeRuntz for the serial number.
     
## 3. Create a folder for the project and open that folder in VSCode
The gradlew file bust be in the root of the folder that you open for this to work.
     
# How to build and deploy the code

## 1. Build the code
Hold Ctrl + Shift + P to open the command pallete, and type
